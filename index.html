		<h1> The Solar System </h1>
		<p> Many people over many thousands of years have looked up at the stars and have contributed to what we know today. <a href = "importantAstronomers.html">Here</a> are 10 of the most
			influential astronomers to have lived. </p>

		<h5> The Sun and planets (distances not to scale) </h5>
		<h2> Discovery </h2>
		<p> For most of history, humans did not recognize or understand the concept of the Solar System. Most people up to the Renaissance period
			believed that the Earth was at the centre of the universe. Even though the Greek philosopher Aristarchus of Samos had considered that the
			Sun was at the centre of the solar system, it was Nicolaus Copernicus who first proved that using mathematics. </p>
		<p> In the 17th century, Galileo discovered that the Sun was marked with sunspots, and that Jupiter had four objects orbiting it. Christiaan
			Huygens discovered Saturn&rsquo;s moon Titan and the shape of the planet&rsquo;s rings. In 1705, Edmond Halley realised that repeated sightings of a
			comet were recording the same object, returning every 75–76 years. This was the first evidence that something other than the planets
			orbited the Sun. Around this time, the term &rsquo;Solar System&rsquo; first appeared in the English language. </p>

		<h5> Comprehensive overview of the Solar System. The Sun, planets, dwarf planets and moons are at scale for their relative sizes, not for
			distances. A separate distance scale is at the bottom. Moons are listed near their planets by proximity of their orbits; only the
			largest moons are shown. </h5>
		<h2> Sun </h2>
		<img src = "sun.jpg" width = "1050" height = "591" alt = "Size comparison of the Sun to other planets." />
		<h5> Size comparison of the Sun and the planets </h5>
		<p> The Sun is the Solar System&rsquo;s star and by far its most massive component. Its large mass, which comprises 99.86% of all the mass in the
			Solar System, produces temperatures and densities in its core high enough to sustain nuclear fusion of hydrogen into helium, making it
			a main-sequence star. This releases an enormous amount of energy, mostly radiated into space as electromagnetic radiation, peaking in
			visible light. </p>
		<p> The Sun is a G2-type main-sequence star. Hotter main-sequence stars are more luminous. The Sun&rsquo;s temperature is intermediate between
			that of the hottest stars and that of the coolest stars. Stars brighter and hotter than the Sun are rare, whereas substantially dimmer
			and cooler stars, known as red dwarfs, make up 85% of the stars in the Milky Way. </p>
		<p> The Sun is a population I star; it has a higher abundance of elements heavier than hydrogen and helium than the older population II
			stars. Elements heavier than hydrogen and helium were formed in the cores of ancient and exploding stars, so the first generation of
			stars had to die before the Universe could be enriched with these atoms. The oldest stars contain few metals, whereas stars born later
			have more. This high metallicity is thought to have been crucial to the Sun's development of a planetary system because the planets
			form from the accretion of &rsquo;metals&rsquo;. </p>
		<h2> Inner planets </h2>
		<img src = "innerPlanets.jpg" width = "1050" height = "591" alt = "Size comparison of the inner planets." />
		<h5> The inner planets. From left to right: Earth, Mars, Venus, and Mercury (sizes to scale). </h5>
		<h2> Mercury </h2>
		<p> Mercury (0.4 AU from the Sun) is the closest planet to the Sun and on average, all seven other planets. The smallest planet in the
			Solar System, Mercury has no natural satellites. Besides impact craters, its only known geological features are lobed ridges or rupes
			that were probably produced by a period of contraction early in its history. Mercury&rsquo;s very tenuous atmosphere consists of atoms
			blasted off its surface by the solar wind. Its relatively large iron core and thin mantle have not yet been adequately explained.
			Hypotheses include that its outer layers were stripped off by a giant impact, or that it was prevented from fully accreting by the
			young Sun&rsquo;s energy. </p>
		<h2> Venus </h2>
		<p> Venus (0.7 AU from the Sun) is close in size to Earth and, like Earth, has a thick silicate mantle around an iron core, a substantial
			atmosphere, and evidence of internal geological activity. It is much drier than Earth, and its atmosphere is ninety times as dense.
			Venus has no natural satellites. It is the hottest planet, with surface temperatures over 400 °C, most likely due to the amount of
			greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. No definitive evidence of current geological activity has been detected on Venus, but it has no
			magnetic field that would prevent depletion of its substantial atmosphere, which suggests that its atmosphere is being replenished by
			volcanic eruptions. </p>
		<h2> Earth </h2>
		<p> Earth (1 AU from the Sun) is the largest and densest of the inner planets, the only one known to have current geological activity, and
			the only place where life is known to exist. Its liquid hydrosphere is unique among the terrestrial planets, and it is the only planet
			where plate tectonics have been observed. Earth's atmosphere is radically different from those of the other planets, having been altered
			by the presence of life to contain 21% free oxygen. It has one natural satellite, the Moon, the only large satellite of a terrestrial planet
			in the Solar System. </p>
		<h2> Mars </h2>
		<p> Mars (1.5 AU from the Sun) is smaller than Earth and Venus. It has an atmosphere of mostly carbon dioxide with a surface pressure of
			6.1 millibars. Its surface, peppered with vast volcanoes such as Olympus Mons, and rift valleys such as Valles Marineris, shows
			geological activity that may have persisted until as recently as 2 million years ago. Its red colour comes from iron oxide in its soil.
			Mars has two tiny moons (Deimos and Phobos) thought to be either captured asteroids, or ejected debris from a massive
			impact early in Mars&rsquo;s history. </p>
		<h2> Outer planets </h2>
		<img src = "outerSolarSystem.jpg" width = "1050" height = "591" alt = "Size comparison of the outer planets." />
		<h5> The outer planets (in the background) Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune, compared to the inner planets Earth, Venus, Mars and Mercury (in the foreground). </h5>
		<h2> Jupiter </h2>
		<p> Jupiter (5.2 AU), is 2.5 times the mass of all the other planets put together. It is composed largely of hydrogen and helium. Jupiter&rsquo;s
			strong internal heat creates semi-permanent features in its atmosphere, such as cloud bands and the Great Red Spot. Jupiter has 79 known
			satellites. The four largest, Ganymede, Callisto, Io, and Europa, show similarities to the terrestrial planets, such as volcanism and
			internal heating. Ganymede, the largest satellite in the Solar System, is larger than Mercury. </p>
		<h2> Saturn </h2>
		<p> Saturn (9.5 AU), distinguished by its extensive ring system, has several similarities to Jupiter, such as its atmospheric composition and
			magnetosphere. Although Saturn has 60% of Jupiter&rsquo;s volume, it is less than a third as massive. Saturn is the only planet of the Solar System
			that is less dense than water. The rings of Saturn are made up of small ice and rock particles. Saturn has 62 confirmed satellites composed
			largely of ice. Two of these, Titan and Enceladus, show signs of geological activity. Titan, the second-largest moon in the Solar System, is
			larger than Mercury and the only satellite in the Solar System with a substantial atmosphere. </p>
		<h2> Uranus </h2>
		<p> Uranus (19.2 AU), is the lightest of the outer planets. Uniquely among the planets, it orbits the Sun on its side; its axial tilt is over
			ninety degrees to the ecliptic. It has a much colder core than the other giant planets and radiates very little heat into space. Uranus has
			27 known satellites, the largest ones being Titania, Oberon, Umbriel, Ariel, and Miranda. </p>
		<h2> Neptune </h2>
		<p> Neptune (30.1 AU), though slightly smaller than Uranus, is more massive and hence more dense. It radiates more internal heat, but not as much
			as Jupiter or Saturn. Neptune has 14 known satellites. The largest, Triton, is geologically active, with geysers of liquid nitrogen. Triton
			is the only large satellite with a retrograde orbit. Neptune is accompanied in its orbit by several minor planets, termed Neptune trojans,
			that are in 1:1 resonance with it. </p>
